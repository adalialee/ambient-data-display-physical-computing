# Sonic Bloom

## Ambient Data Display Project
 
### Adalia Lee and Isabella Pan

Sonic Bloom is an interactive installation that explores the relationship between sound frequencies and plant growth. Inspired by scientific research on how different sound waves can influence plant gene expression, we created a system where users can engage with this phenomenon in a simplified and tangible way. The installation is intended to be displayed in a science museum exhibit to teach people about how sound frequencies affect plant growth.

Sonic Bloom features three plants, each with signage representing different biological responses to sound. We created paper cutouts and printed images for a water lily, orchid, and thale cress. Crocheted vines hide the chopsticks that serve as the plant stems, and crocheted roots hide the servos. A cardboard box covered by grass printouts houses the Arduino Uno and breadboard that power the installation.

By pressing arcade buttons corresponding to different frequency ranges — low: 0 - 333 Hz, medium: 334 - 667 Hz, and high: 668 - 1,00+ Hz — visitors activate the servos that rotate signage, revealing how specific frequencies impact growth factors such as photosynthesis, defense mechanisms, and stress responses in the different plants. Through these interactions, Sonic Bloom transforms scientific data into an immersive and educational experience, bridging the gap between art, technology, and biology.

This project invites audiences to reconsider the less noticeable connections between sound and nature, emphasizing the delicate, yet powerful ways in which environmental factors shape life. Sonic Bloom is both an artistic representation and an interactive learning tool, encouraging curiosity about the intricate ways living organisms respond to their surroundings.
